KFM character by Elecbyte
Tag Code (tag_system.cns) by AeroGP
Code Applied to KFM by mh777

*Notes*
I take no credit whatsoever for the tag code, as it was originally made by AeroGP. 
I just applied it to KFM as an example to show that the code does indeed work.

*Usage*
To see the code in action, pick Team Arcade and play in Simul mode.  Choose KFM as 
both of your characters.  During the KFM intro at the beginning of the round, press
Ctrl+3 on your keyboard.  This will give you control of your partner when you tag him
in.  To tag, press the Z+C buttons.  You must have at least one power stock to tag your 
partner in.

For more information on the tag code, please read the readme_TAG.txt included with this 
character.  It is the same readme that originally came with AeroGP's tag code file.
(You don't mind, right?)

*Thanks*
